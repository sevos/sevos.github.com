# New Year's resolutions

It's common to say, that resolutions made at beggining of year
just don't work. Although I would like to set directions of improving myself for coming year. I hope to revisit them by end of 2013 ;-).

- pay off debts
- establish security savings
- have true vacation
- write more
- spend more time with family
- shift from 8am-1am day to 6am-22pm day
- quit tv-series addiction
- start doing some sport
