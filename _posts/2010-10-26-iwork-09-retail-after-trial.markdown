# iWork '09 Retail after trial 

Perhaps you installed iWork '09 trial in order to give it a chance. Perhaps you was amazed by this great suite and wanted to use it also after 30 days period. If you live, like me, in country where you cannot buy an online CD-Key, you have to go to retail store or Apple reseller and buy a retail version of iWork '09. And that's what I did.

Unfortunately when I came back to home, opened the box and installed suit from DVD, it was not been working. After launching Pages I got request for CD-Key. WTF? I asked uncle Google and got to know that Apple didn't require any serials for retail disc installations.

Solution:

1. Go to your Applications directory
2. Drag iWork '09 directory to the bin
3. Open you Macintosh HD directory (just root directory) and go to Library
4. Open Application support folder
5. Drag iWork '09 folder to the trash bin
6. Empty your trash bin
7. Proceed with standard installation from retail disc

I hope that it will help you. I wasted 15 minutes for finding this solution.
